## Project Overview:
- Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

## Purpose of Project:
The purpose of this challenge is to use unsupervised machine learning to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies and create a report including the traded cryptocurrencies classified by group according to their features. Since there is a vast amount of information on cryptocurriences, the report will include what cryptocurriencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new investment.  
Data visualizations will also be used to share findings.
